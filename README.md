# LiveLock
## An integrated time booking and access control solution for music studios.  Built on Rails.
#### Work in progress

### Summary

My capstone project as part of the Metis bootcamp, LiveLock is an integrated music studio booking and access control system. I'm building a custom time-booking app that allows the customer to book their studio session online and be automatically granted access to the space with their phone via the Lockitron API. More to come. This is a very exciting project.
